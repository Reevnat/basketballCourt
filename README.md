Java Coursework for Advanced Programming: Concurrency module in Software Engineering at City University. 

Model the following scenario in Java: 
Two feuding gangs, the Sharks and the Jets, want to use a basketball court that’s
at the border of their territories. But whenever they meet up, carnage ensues. So,
they install two flags at the opposite sides of the court.
When a gang wants to visit the court, they raise their flag and set the
turn indicator to the other gang (this is supposed to defeat greed) – then
they check the turn indicator and their rivals’ flag. If they see their rivals’
flag and it is their rivals’ turn, they need to wait and check again.
Otherwise, they can go to the court and once done, they lower their flag.
